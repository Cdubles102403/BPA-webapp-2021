# NODE SERVER TEMPLATE

## Desctiption

Just a simple node server template to use as a foundation for other projects. Should also contain a description of what does what for the server for ease of modification.

## Installation

Once downloaded, use bash to install express and chalk. If package-lock.json is present you should be able to do this the shorthand way.

```bash
npm install
```

If this doesn't work, install each one manually using hte following commands.

```bash
npm install express
npm install chalk
```

## Usage

To start the server, just type the node command

```bash
node server
```

To start in testing mode, use the following command.

```bash 
npx nodemon server.js
```

This will start the server in test mode, so every time you hit Save it will reload the server.
